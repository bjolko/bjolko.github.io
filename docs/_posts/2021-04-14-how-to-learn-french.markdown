One of my New year resolutions was to learn French and pass the DELF B1 exam. I made it, so I want to share how I did it without courses and tutors. Allons-y!

## General advice

Three main things that helped me to accomplish this project:
1. Habit tracker to mark the days I studied French. Try [Loop Habit Tracker for Andoid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits) and [Productive for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/productive-habit-tracker/id983826477).
2. Progress Sheet in my notebook to list all the textbooks I studied, books I read and films I watched. It helps to see current achievements and inspires me to work further.
3. Fixed place and time for study to focus faster and to build a habit.

## January -- February

You need to start with basics: get acquainted with pronunciation and reading rules and learn must-have phrases such as "Hello!" and "What's up?". For me, the first couple of weeks were painful because French is very different from languages I already knew, English and Russian.

[Memrise App](https://www.memrise.com/). The app team made several introductory courses with audio and video materials. The first three will teach you how to introduce yourself, order food and talk about your work.

[Learn French in 35 days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5fqFNAZpRg&list=PLZNV0gmRjgU8NkwZih6BS5X98v9PdrHk3). An introduction to pronunciation, writing and French grammar.

## March -- April
I envy people who learned French by singing songs because it is not working for me until I understand the language structure and its logic. Therefore, I found [Easy French Step-by-Step](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071453873) self-study guide with exercises. I learnt the foundations of grammar and expanded my vocabulary. After that the Chamber of Secrets was open and _"Ça doit, faire au moins mille fois que j'ai compté mes doigts"_ from Papaoutai lyrics didn't sound like abracadabra anymore.

At the same time, I watched [Extra French](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2mv2wEdsVY1Yt2OAQniz0g/feed) -- sitcom-style language series for beginners.

## May -- July

At this stage, I already could hear and distinguish the words and speak elementary French. In May I saw my first film, and in June I read my first book. I'm a big fan of learning languages from TV shows, but the problem is that the French do not film them as much! My lifehack was to watch How I Met Your Mother in French dubbing, by the way, an excellent one.

As a study source, I watched an old classic TV course [French in Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_in_Action). There are 52 episodes entirely in French and a textbook and a workbook to practice. Each lesson is a story about the same characters with new vocabulary and context.

In June, I discovered sentence mining with Anki flashcards, i.e. learning sentences instead of isolated words. Here is an excellent collection [16000 French sentences sorted from easiest to hardest](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1089240419) of sentences with audio.

## August -- September

Moving on from learning materials for beginners, I looked up through French teachers communities on social media for more complex textbooks.

[Compréhension orale 2 — Niveau B1](https://www.cle-international.com/comprehension-orale-2-niveau-b1-livre-cd-2eme-edition-9782090380057.html) a textbook with listening exercises. Nothing new here: listen to a dialogue or monologue and answer questions.

[Expression écrite 3 — Niveau B1/B1](https://www.cle-international.com/expression-ecrite-3-niveau-b1b1-livre-9782090352085.html). You read a text on a specific topic, answer questions, study tips and tricks and then write an essay.

## October  -- December

It's time to prepare for the DELF B1 exam! I studied these textbooks [DELF B1–200 activités](https://www.cle-international.com/expression-orale-2-niveau-b1-livre-cd-9782090352078.html),  [Réussir le DELF B1](https://www.editionsdidier.com/fr/sous-collection/reussir-le-delf-b1). The last one is a classic written by the exam authors for all levels. Additionally, you can try [Alter Ego 3](http://www.hachettefle.com/adultes/pages/catalogue/fiche-livre/alter-ego-3-livre-de-l-eleve-cd-audio-1555127.html), but I heard about it too late :)

I also took all the practice tests I could find, read four books, watched two films and the "Stranger Things" TV show and completed one MOOC.

Result: the passed exam and a long-expected vacation :)
